What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?

    The browser resolves “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into an IP address through DNS, making
    a request to that IP with the headers that were used. Server then sends a response which if successful
    then follows with the browser developing a DOM with any other additional resources from that HTML. Separate
    HTTP requests are also handled by the browser for those resourses while also receiving responses
    for each from the server.
